# Example Diagnostics Outputs

This directory contains **example outputs** generated by the BOUT++ Tokamak Grid Diagnostics utility.

These examples are intended to demonstrate:

- the structure of the generated HTML reports
- the types of plots produced (geometry, magnetic fields, spacing diagnostics, etc.)
- the JSON schema and validation summaries

They are **not** intended to provide canonical or physically authoritative reference grids.

## Important: What is (and is not) included

You will notice directories such as:

- `d3d_119919.nc/`
- `grid_circular_reference.nc/`
- `grid_extreme_k2.2_d0.5.nc/`
- `grid_iterish_k1.7_d0.33.nc/`

These are **directories**, not netCDF files.

Each directory contains the diagnostics outputs generated *from* a grid with that name:

- `*_report.html` – interactive diagnostics report
- `*_report.json` – machine-readable validation output
- `*_render.png` – geometry visualization
- `*_bfield.png` – magnetic field visualization (if fields were present)

The underlying netCDF grid files themselves are **not included** in this repository.

This is intentional:

- Many grids are large (hundreds of MB to GB).
- Some originate from external projects (e.g. Hypnotoad, Hermes, experimental reconstructions).
- Redistributing third-party grids is often inappropriate or unfair to the original authors.

This repository focuses on demonstrating the **diagnostics output**, not acting as a grid archive.

## Provenance of examples

The examples shown here were generated from grids originating from:

- **Hypnotoad** (BOUT++ integrated test suite)  
  https://github.com/boutproject/hypnotoad

- **Hermes**  
  https://github.com/boutproject/hermes

- **bout_tokamak_grid_generator.py** (Chatwood Labs)  
  https://github.com/Chatwood-Labs/bout-tools/tree/main/bout_tokamak_grid

Specific examples:

- `d3d_119919.nc` – Hermes / DIII-D derived grid
- `expected_orthogonal.grd.nc`, `expected_nonorthogonal.grd.nc` – Hypnotoad test grids
- `grid_circular_reference.nc`, `grid_extreme_k2.2_d0.5.nc`, `grid_iterish_k1.7_d0.33.nc` – generated using `bout_tokamak_grid_generator.py`

Again: only the **diagnostics outputs** are included here.

## Reproducing these examples

If you have access to the original grid files, you can reproduce any example by running:

```bash
python bout_tokamak_grid_diagnostics.py path/to/grid.nc
```

This will generate:

- `*_report.html`
- `*_report.json`
- `*_render.png`
- `*_bfield.png` (if magnetic fields are present)

in the same directory as the grid file (or in --outdir if specified).

## Why this structure?

Keeping each example’s outputs in a directory named after the source grid makes it:

- obvious which outputs belong together
- easy to compare multiple examples
- trivial to add new examples without cluttering the root

This layout is intentional and part of the tool's documentation strategy.

## Disclaimer

These examples are provided for illustration and validation structure only.

They are not:

- equilibrium validations
- benchmark references
- or endorsed physics models

Treat them as diagnostic demonstrations, not ground truth.
